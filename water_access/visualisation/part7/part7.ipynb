    "\n",
    "When reviewing the report from our previous project, it's been challenging to understand how the data fits together.\n",
    "\n",
    "To design an effective report, we use a \"user story\" framework. This framework helps us put ourselves in the shoes of the end users to understand their needs and how they will interact with the report. \n",
    "\n",
    "### National Level Dashboard Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s approach this from the perspective of one of our users. Picture yourself as the company director, and we are aiming to:\n",
    "1. See the key points of the survey results to understand the overall status of water access in Maji Ndogo.\n",
    "2. Know how many people are affected by water access challenges and what those challenges are.\n",
    "3. Understand how much money is needed to complete the upgrades, and where that money needs to be spent.\n",
    "4. View and understand this data at both the national and provincial levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin with our director's page, which is structured around three key components: the population/water breakdown, \"What do we need to do?\" and \"How much will it cost?\". To effectively present this information, we will split the dashboard into these three sections while also reserving space for slicers to enable dynamic filtering of data. Additionally, we will allocate space to highlight the big idea results that directly address the core purpose: \"How much do we need to spend in Maji Ndogo, and what will that money do?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework is a starting point for our visualisations, we’ll continue to adjust and refine the visuals based on the data and insights we gather.\n",

    "- What do we need to do, and where do we need to do it?\n",
    "- What will this cost?\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of this data story follows a logical progression. We start by understanding who we are improving water access for, then we identify the areas where improvements are needed, and finally, we address the associated costs. This order makes sense, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, for each of these user stories, we have to think about **what data** the user will need to answer that question and **how** will we visualise that data.\n",

    "So let's apply the what and the how.\n",
    "1. See the key points of the survey results to understand the overall status of water access in Maji Ndogo.\n",
    "    - We should summarise population-related access to water on a national and provincial level.\n",
    "    - A lot of people in Maji Ndogo live in rural and urban areas, so we should summarise their results and the challenges they face separately by splitting the page into rural vs urban.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Know how many people are affected by water access challenges in Maji Ndogo and what those challenges are.\n",
    "    - We need to communicate the number of sources, and also the amount of people affected by these sources by showing the distribution of source types in rural vs. urban populations.\n",
    "    - Perhaps we should also consider making the less important sources like tap_in_homes less visible since we're not upgrading those.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. View and understand how much money we will need to complete the upgrades, and where that money needs to be spent.\n",
    "     - We need to show a single number representing the data nationally, and per province. There is some financial data in our data model called `infrastructure_cost`, but we will need to do some calculations to include this type of data. We will need to see this data at a national, provincial, and rural/urban level, and even per `improvement` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. View and understand this data on a national level and a provincial level.\n",
    "    - We have to take this into account, as well as at a rural/urban split. If we build the report well, we can drill down into different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a new visuals page, National, a title, and start adding visuals! We will also, add a slicer to the controls section so that we can select provinces. I also added a map. So now, when we select a province in the slicer, the map highlights where that province is.\n",

    "- Public taps are improved sources, but only if the queue time is less than 30 min.\n",
    "- Broken infrastructure \"taps\" are not basic, because they do not work.\n",
    "- All taps installed in homes across Maji Ndogo are at least basic. They are actually safely managed.\n",
