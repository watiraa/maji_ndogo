    "As part of the Maji Ndogo water source improvement project, we received a comprehensive report highlighting key areas for strategic action. This data has not only informed our budget planning but also facilitated conversations with international funders who are supporting solutions to address this critical issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The journey to improve water access has officially begun, and we’re thrilled to share that the first few water sources are now operational. But there’s one more crucial task at hand—building a dashboard to showcase the impact of this initiative.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dashboard will serve two important purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Public Transparency**: To show stakeholders and the community where the funds are being allocated and the tangible outcomes of their support.\n",

    "2. **Project Oversight**: To empower decision-makers with actionable insights, ensuring the project stays on track and resources are utilized effectively.\n",

    "    - `date`, `biological`, `description`, and `pollutant_ppm` columns from `well_pollution`\n",
    "    - `address` column from `location`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Remove the `queue_composition` table and `water_source_related_crime tables`.\n",

To make the visual more meaningful, we need to create a measure to reflect the `Project Progress (%)` metric.\n",

    "1. When we have to drill wells, it is expensive. We took this into account in our budget, so this is not the reason for the high costs.\n",
    "2. When sources are in rural areas, costs are higher. We took this into account in our budget, so this is not the reason for the high costs.\n",
