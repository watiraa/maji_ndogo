# Restoring the Flow of Maji Ndogo & Rebuilding Hope

## Introduction

In Maji Ndogo and communities worldwide, **access to clean and reliable water** is essential for daily life. This project addresses the **water crisis** in a fictional country named **Maji Ndogo**, with a focus on rejuvenating the drying *Mto wa Matumaini* â€“ The River of Hope. Using a data-driven approach, this project highlights how SQL can be applied to address complex data challenges, uncover meaningful insights, and pave the way for informed decision-making that can help combat the water crisis.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into four parts, each one progressively increasing in SQL syntax complexity and analytical depth. These sections serve as a comprehensive guide on approaching and resolving data-driven challenges while showcasing the power of SQL.

# [Part 1: Beginning Our Data-Driven Journey in Maji Ndogo](./water_access/exploration/part1.ipynb)

In the first part, we explore Maji Ndogo's extensive database of 60,000 records across various tables. Through **basic queries**, we familiarize ourselves with the dataset, clean some of the data, and refine it using Data Manipulation Language (**DML**).

### Objectives

- **Create** and **navigate through a new database**.
- **Modify** and **refine basic queries using conditional filters and operators**.
- **Utilize DML** effectively while understanding the **risks of altering a database**.


# [Part 2: Clustering Data to Unveil Maji Ndogo's Water Crisis](./water_access/exploration/part2.ipynb)

In this section, we use **SQL functions**, including **complex window functions**, to analyze Maji Ndogo's water situation and draw deeper insights from the data.

### Objectives

- Apply **SQL functions** and **window functions** to **clean and analyze** data.
- Perform data **aggregation techniques** to unravel the scale of the problem, and start to form some actionable insights

# [Part 3: Weaving the Data Threads of Maji Ndogo's Narrative](./water_access/exploration/part3.ipynb)

Here, we will pull data from **multiple tables** and perform **statistical analyses** to evaluate the findings of an audit report. This section highlights the challenges of combining data from different sources.

### Objectives

- **Retrieve** and *combine data from various sources**.
- Use advanced SQL tools to **assemble the pieces of an audit together**.
- Understanding the challenges associated with **joining multiple data sources together**.

# Part 4: Charting the Course for Maji Ndogo's Water Future(./water_access/exploration/part4.ipynb)

In the final part of the project, we will conclude our data analysis using the **full suite of SQL tools**. We will derive our final insights, categorize water sources, and prepare relevant information for relevant stakeholders i.e. Maji Ndogo's engineering teams.

### Objectives

- Use advanced SQL features like **subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and views**.
- **Integrate filters, aggregations, joins, and functions** into a cohesive analysis.
- Assemble our **final analysis results**, and **report our findings**.
- Look to the future as we derive **actionable goals**, and shape the data to
achieve them.

## Additional Files

- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Visualizing the database schema for the project. Available in the [`assets`](./water_access/assets/) folder.
- **Visuals and Charts**: Supporting graphics from SQL analyses can be found in the [`assets`](./water_access/assets/) folder.

> ## **NOTE**:
- All notebooks contain detailed explanations to showcase the thought process behind the analysis.
- Future updates will include linking Power BI visualizations and extending the analysis further.
