    "To determine whether there are discrepancies between the water quality scores from auditors and surveyors, we will need to create some joins. Here's the breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `auditor_report` table in our database includes a `location_id` attribute, while the `water_quality` table contains a `record_id` attribute, which corresponds to a similar attribute in the `visits` table. \n",
    "- The `visits` table has both `location_id` and `record_id` attributes, making it the ideal table for joining the `auditor_report` and `water_quality` tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct the appropriate SQL query for retrieving the necessary information from the various tables, let's start with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grab the `location_id` and `true_water_source_score` columns from `auditor_report`.\n",
    "- **JOIN** the `visits` table with the `auditor_report` table using the shared `location_id` table to access the `record_id`.\n",
    "- Now that we have the `record_id` for each location, our next step is to retrieve the corresponding scores from the `water_quality` table. We are particularly interested in the `subjective_quality_score`. To do this, we'll **JOIN** the `visits` table and the `water_quality` table, using the `record_id` as the connecting key.\n",
    "- Clean up the resulting table by removing unnecessary redundant columns and renaming the score columns to `surveyor_score` and `auditor_score`, respectively.\n",
    "- Use a `WHERE` clause in the query to check for differences between the surveyor_score and auditor_score."
