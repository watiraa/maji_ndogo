Remember the few important things that apply to `tap_in_home` and `broken_tap_in_home`? The surveyors combined the data of many households together and added this as a single tap record, but each household actually has its own tap. In addition to this, there is an average of 6 people living in a home. So 6 people actually share 1 tap (not 644). We can see that `shared_tap` has the highest number of total number of people served in our database. It is always important to think about data. We tend to just analyse, and calculate at the start of our careers, but the value we bring as data\n",

    "The average queue time is around 123 minutes, meaning that people spend about two hours fetching water if they don’t have taps in their homes. While that may seem manageable, it’s worth noting that demand could vary throughout the week, with more people likely to collect water on certain days due to personal schedules or resource availability. Let’s dive deeper and explore the third question by examining how queue times vary across different days of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "`DAY()` gives you the day of the month. If we want to aggregate data for each day of the week, we need to use another DateTime function, `DAYNAME(column)`. As the name suggests, it returns the day of the week as a string — Monday, Tuesday, and so on—based on the timestamp in the `time_of_record` column. By calculating the average queue time and grouping it by day of the week, we can better understand patterns in queue times across the week."

    "# Water Accessibility and Infrastructure Summary Report\n",
    "\n",
    "This survey aimed to identify the water sources people use and determine both the total and average number of users for each source. Additionally, it examined the duration citizens typically spend in queues to access water. So let's create a short summary report we can send off to relevant stakeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Most water sources are rural.\n",
    "2. **43%** of our people are using shared taps. **2000** people often share one tap.\n",
    "3. **31%** of our population has water infrastructure in their homes, but within that group, **45%** face non-functional systems due to issues with pipes, pumps, and reservoirs.\n",
    "4. **18%** of our people are using wells of which, but within that, only **28%** are clean..\n",
    "5. Our citizens often face long wait times for water, averaging more than **120 minutes**.\n",
    "6. In terms of queues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Queues are very long on Saturdays.\n",
    "- Queues are longer in the mornings and evenings.\n",
    "- Wednesdays and Sundays have the shortest queues.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Strategy for Solving the Water Crisis in Maji Ndogo\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider a strategy to begin addressing Maji Ndogo's water crisis, it might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We want to focus our efforts on improving the water sources that affect the most people.\n",
    "- Most people will benefit if we improve the shared taps first.\n",
    "- Wells are a good source of water, but many are contaminated. Fixing this will benefit a lot of people.\n",
    "- Fixing existing infrastructure will help many people. If they have running water again, they won't have to queue, thereby shorting queue times for others. So we can solve two problems at once.\n",
    "- Installing taps in homes will stretch our resources too thin, so for now, if the queue times are low, we won't improve that source.\n",
    "2. Most water sources are in rural areas. We need to ensure our teams know this as this means they will have to make these repairs/upgrades in rural areas where road conditions, supplies, and labour are harder challenges to overcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recommended Pratical Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If communities are using **rivers**, we can dispatch trucks to those regions to provide water temporarily in the short term, while we send out crews to drill for wells, providing a more permanent solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If communities are using **wells**, we can install filters to purify the water. For wells with **biological** contamination, we can **install UV filters** that kill microorganisms, and for *polluted wells*, we can **install reverse osmosis filters**. In the long term, we need to figure out why these sources are polluted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For **shared taps**, in the short term, we can send additional water tankers to the busiest taps, on the busiest days. We can use the queue time pivot table we made to send tankers at the busiest times. Meanwhile, we can start the work on **installing extra taps** where they are needed. According to UN standards, the maximum acceptable wait time for water is 30 minutes. With this in mind, our aim is to **install taps** to get **queue times below 30 min**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Shared taps** with **short queue times** (< 30 min) represent a logistical challenge to further reduce waiting times. The most effective solution, installing taps in homes, is resource-intensive and better suited as a long-term goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Addressing broken infrastructure** offers a significant impact even with just a single intervention. It is expensive to fix, but so **many people** can **benefit** from repairing one facility. For example, fixing a reservoir or pipe that multiple taps are connected to. We will have to find the commonly affected areas though to see where the problem actually is."
