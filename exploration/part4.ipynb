    "There’s still some analysis to finalize, followed by creating a table to help Maji Ndogo's engineers monitor their progress. Let’s start with the final steps of the analysis. It might be tempting to combine all columns from all tables into one table for analysis, but with a database of this scale, doing so would likely cause performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could spend a minute thinking about the questions we still have, and create queries to answer them, specifically. Doing this means that we will only use the data we need to answer our question. Let's summarise the data we need, and where to find it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All of the information about the location of a water source is in the `location` table, specifically the town and province of that water source.\n",
    "- `water_source` has the `type_of_source` and the `number_of_people_served` by each source.\n",
    "- `visits` has queue information, and connects `source_id` to `location_id`. There were multiple visits to sites, so we need to be careful not to include duplicate data (visit_count > 1).\n",
    "- `well_pollution` has information about the quality of water from only wells, so we need to keep that in mind when we join this table.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**: Previously, we couldn't link provinces and towns to the type of water sources, the number of people served by those sources, queue times, or pollution data, but we can now. So, what type of relationships can we look at?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things to think about:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are there any specific provinces, or towns where some sources are more abundant?\n",
    "2. We identified that `tap_in_home_broken` taps are easy wins. Are there any towns where this is a particular problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer question 1, we will need `province_name` and `town_name` from the `location` table. We also need to know `type_of_water_source` and `number_of_people_served` from the `water_source` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the `location` table uses `location_id` while `water_source` only has `source_id`. So we won't be able to join these tables directly. But the `visits` table maps `location_id` and `source_id`. So if we use `visits` as the table we query from, we can join `location` where the `location_id` matches, and `water_source` where the `source_id` matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to assemble data into a table first before we can analyse it. This approach will streamline our analysis and make it much easier!"

To get around that, we need to first group by province and then by town. This way, the duplicate town names will be distinct because they belong to different provinces."

    "But look at the `tap_in_home` percentages in Sokoto too. Some of Maji Ndogo's citizens are forced to drink unsafe water from a river, while a lot of people have running water in their homes in Sokoto. Large disparities in water access like this show that the wealth distribution in Sokoto very unequal. We should mention this in Maji Ndogo's report. Maji Ndogo should also send their drilling teams to Sokoto first to drill some wells for the people who are drinking river water, specifically the rural parts and the city of Bahari.\n",

More than half of the people in Amina have taps installed in their homes, but they are not working. Maji Ndogo should send out their teams to go and fix the infrastructure in Amina first. Fixing taps in people's homes, means those people don't have to queue for water anymore making queues in Amina shorter!\n",

Towns like Amina, the rural parts of Amanzi, and a couple of towns across Akatsi and Hawassa have broken infrastructure.\n",
    "4. **18%** of Maji Ndogo's people are using wells of which, but within that, only **28%** are clean. These are mostly in Hawassa, Kilimani and Akatsi.\n",
    "5. Maji Ndogo's citizens often face long wait times for water, averaging more than **120 minutes**: \n",
    "    - Queues are very long on Saturdays. \n",
    "    - Queues are longer in the mornings and evenings. \n",

As our final task, we will create a table that provides Maji Ndogo's teams with the necessary information to address, upgrade, and repair water sources. This table will include the addresses of locations they need to visit (street address, town, province), the type of water source that requires improvement, and\n",
